# Compressing-Dynamical-Systems-Atari

This is both an implementation of the paper "[Action-Conditional Video Prediction using Deep Networks in Atari Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.08750)" and an extenstion of some of their results. This paper looks at predicting future frames of the Atari video game given action sequencses. The method proposed works by taking in 


## Model
There are two models that can be trained with this code. The "paper" model is a replica of the original model given in the paper. The "compression" model is very similar in structure but learns a
